### Excel & Python

There are many opinions over which is better in data analysis work, between Excel and Python. Actually, Excel and Python were developed based on different original purposes, with different usages and characteristics. Python is a programming/scripting language while Excel was developed as a spread sheet software. Despite the different features, each has its own advantage in data analysis job and I think they can be utilized in a complementary way.

### Advantage of Excel
- Simple data analysis from well-prepared data
- Convenient and visualized reporting
### Advantage of Python
- Data wrangling and cleansing work from different sources
- Detailed data analysis
- Complicated prediction modelling

For most people, the most efficient platform would be one most familiar to themselves. I am a person familiar to Excel, but I am a fast-learner, with an open-mind. To compare each function for a test, I implemented simple analysis using Excel and Python from the same data source. The result can be checked from the attached files.

1. The source file: house_data.csv
2. house_data_PivotTable_Chart_Regression.xlsx
3. house_data_basic.ipynb
4. house_data_visualize.ipynb

As shown at the three files(2-4), the function of Python is better than that of Excel in detailed data analysis, including linear regression modelling. Excel has limitations in the data wrangling as well as more focused analysis similar to the SQL queries. Of course, excel can extend its functions with connection to the SQL Server. The sheet of ‘Re_house_data’ was created with aids from SQL Server. (I had to convert the string format of ‘date’ column in the source data into ‘Year’ and ‘Month’ in the SQL Server platform and export it as a csv file.)

Nevertheless, excel is very efficient and easy to directly manipulate data in a relatively simple analysis work. One of its powerful advantages is built-in functions and convenient reporting using pivot table/chart functions. Compared to the pivot by Python (outcome [30]), pivot table by excel presents a better overview about the data in quality visualization.
Fortunately, new technologies have been constantly emerging. Now, it is possible to import/export Excel files to/from Python.
