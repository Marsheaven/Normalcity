### Microsoft SQL Server 2012

These works are the projects that I've finished to get the Certificate in Microsoft Business Intelligence, along with the TSQL practices.
I used the Microsoft SQL Server Data Tool for the three projects. As my final work was the sln file, unfortunately, which is not opened normally in different envrionments. Instead, I added solution points(Solution_Points.md) to provide understandings about my projects. 

- SSIS(SQL Server Integration Service) Project
- SSAS(SQL Server Analysis Service) Project
- SSRS(SQL Server Reporting Service) Project
- T-SQL Queries

The T-SQL Queries include Key SQL query examples and my practice work using the Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio.
