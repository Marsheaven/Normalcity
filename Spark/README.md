### Spark ETL
#### Spark can be used as a pipeline for the simple ETL. I tested the Spark ETL using STM GTFS files(available at http://www.stm.info/en/about/developers).
### Spark Application
#### Anyone can run a Spark Application by following instruction of the guide file(Spark_Application_Guide.pdf). In my case, I faced some error. My solution and re-running the application are included in the file(SparkPi_Application_Exercise.md).
