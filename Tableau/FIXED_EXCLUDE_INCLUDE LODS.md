### FIXED/EXCLUDE/INCLUDE Level of Detail (LOD)

The tableau automatically provides the aggregated sum (default aggregation) by a specific dimension when we select a dimension and a measure. The example 1 below shows the Sales by Category. This is the same value when the Fixed LOD is applied to Category. 

When there are multiple dimensions in the hierarchical relationships, Fixed LOD can be used to show its aggregated value though the default aggregation is applied to another dimension.

In the example 2, the default aggregation of Sales is applied by Sub-Category(lower-level). The Fixed-Category-Sales is the value after Fixed LOD is applied to Category(higher-level).
